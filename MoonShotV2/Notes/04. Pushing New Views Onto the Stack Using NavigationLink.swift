//MARK: 04. Pushing New Views Onto The Stack Using NavigationLink

//SwiftUI's NavigationView shows a navigation bar at the top of our views, but also does something else: it lets us push views onto a view stack. In fact, this is really the most fundamental form of iOS navigation - you can see it in Settings when you tap Wifi of General, or in Messages whenver you tap someone's name.

//This view stack system is very different from the sheets we've used preivously. Yes, both show some sort of new view, but there's a difference in the way they are presented that affects the ways users think about them.
